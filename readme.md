# Dummy NBA stats app
### This is a silly NBA stats app developed with ionic and angular

This is a very basic mobile app developed using ionic and angular in the front-end and an unofficial open NBA stats API (https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba). The data fetched from the API is not modified, manipulated or processed in any way. The response data obtained from the GET request is directly printed on the front-end.

The only goal of this project was to play around with ionic and its UI components and get familiarized with angular as well(I've just worked with Vue.js so far). I've always been curious about mobile dev, so technologies that allowes to develop mobile apps with web technologies sound interesting to me. Ionic would not be my first choice though. Instead, my choice would be between React Native or Flutter, but I got a chance to take part in a freeancing project with Ionic + Angular and that's why I stuck to that stack. I may try React Native or Flutter in the future.

### Disclaimer
I never used ionic or angular before, it was my first experience with both frameworks. As stated before, I just wanted to play around with those technologies, so I developed it in just a couple of days (including the study spikes of ionic and angular). 
I just chose a random API, got the data from it and painted it on te screen. That's why data is not 'consistent'. 
Also, players pictures and teams logos are hardcoded (since the API didn't supply any picture). As you will see I used a Kobe 'Black Mamba' Bryant picture to 'simulate' the players pictures, and the Harlem Globetrotters logo for teams logos.
