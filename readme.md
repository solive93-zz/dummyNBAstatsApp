# Dummy NBA stats app
### This is a silly NBA stats app developed with ionic and angular

I developed this project in a couple of days. I never used ionic or angular before. I didn't develop any backend. All the data painted in the screen comes from an unofficial open NBA stats API (https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba) and the images are hardcoded from internet links (King Kobe for players' picture and Harlem Globetrotters' logo for teams' logo). I didn't manipulate the data in any way, just GET it from the API's endpoints and show it on the screen. Not a big deal.

The only goal of this project was to play around with ionic and its UI components and get familiarized with angular as well(I've just worked with Vue.js so far)
