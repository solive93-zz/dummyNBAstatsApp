# Dummy NBA stats app
### This is a silly NBA stats app developed with ionic and angular

I developed this project in a couple of days. I never used ionic or angular before. This mini-project has no backend. All the data painted in the screen comes from an unofficial open NBA stats API (https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/free-nba). I didn't manipulate the data in any way, just GET it from the API's endpoints and show it on the screen. Not a big deal.
I just wanted to play around with ionic and its UI components and get familiarized with angular (I've just worked with Vue.js so far)
